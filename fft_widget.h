 * \brief Plots a bar graph of the FFT of a time series.
 * \paragraph
 *
 *The FFT Widget displays the Fourier Transform of three different types of data in a bar graph format.
 * There are three sampling types which may be selected using the buttons underneath the plot. From the
 * cuda_take documentation, here are the three different types of time series input by cuda_take:
 * \paragraph
 *
 * \list
 *      1. Frame Mean (Frame Rate sampling) - the average of all pixels in one frame is determined and
 *         used as a single value in the series. Thus, all the frame means combine to make a series with
 *         a length of 1500 frames in time.
 *      2. Vertical Crosshair Profile (Row Clock sampling) - The vertical profile contains the data for
 *         all pixels in one column. This vertical profile is used as the time series input and the FFT
 *         is calculated each frame. Therefore, the image data is being sampled at the rate that rows of
 *         data are sent along the data bus, which is approximately 48 kHz (Pixel Clock / Number of Rows)
 *      3. Tap Profile (Pixel Clock sampling) - All the pixels in a tap with dimensions 160cols x 480 rows
 *         is concatenated into a time series which is input to the FFT. This enables detection of periodic
 *         signals at the pixel level. The sampling rate is equal to the pixel clock, which usually runs at
 *         10MHz. If this value is changed at the hardware level, the value of the pixel clock must be
 *         re-entered, and the program recompiled. (jk - I think this depends on resolution)
 * \paragraph
 *
 * In vertical crosshair FFTs, the number of columns to be binned may be selected using the slider in the
 * controls box. In the tap profile, the tap that is being sampled may be selected using the numbered display
 * next to the button.
